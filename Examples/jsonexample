        s not a bad guy,
        just a perv\ ", 'he's realistic' or even that it's just his character flaws. There's even been incidences of rape and sexual assault being quickly brushed over.\n And what's worse is that these same issues are continually defended or their severity is even sidestepped with phrases of 'it's not that bad\", \"it's just an anime bro, it's not real', 'if you don't like it, don't watch it', 'she's 1000 years old', 'he has the body of a child so it's ok' or whatever seeming justification one can make up.\n And it genuinely scares me. I'll probably get downvoted to all hell for this but I'm honestly quite scared by a lot of the things I'm seeing and how quickly fans go to defend all of it.\n    submitted by    /u/SpicenNiceCookie    to    r/TooAfraidToAsk  \n [link]   [comments]",
